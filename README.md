# Kuref Project
*Kuref* (from [Mapudungun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche_language) 'wind') is an opensource automatic weather station framework that allow developers and enthusiasts to retrieve and process sensors data in a standard, systematic and easy way.

**Note**: This repo serves as a documentation repository and doesn't contain source code.

## Goals

The project aims to provide software and libraries that support the making of low cost weather stations. Furthermore, poses the following specific goals:
*  To use only opensource frameworks and libraries
*  To provide a software library for Arduino to retrieve data from different kind of sensors.
*  To provide a software component to storage and process sensors data in a structured way.
*  To provide a software component to configure and display aggregated sensors information.
*  To provide manuals and documentation that allow assembly, configuration and deployment of the required/proposed hardware and software that conform a reference low cost automatic weather station.

## Current state

Under active development but no release available by the moment.
